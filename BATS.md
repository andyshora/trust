Desmodus Rotundus (common vampire bat)

feed exclusively on blood

vampire bats in the wild commonly share food with other members of the colony by sharing food – in their case, by regurgitating blood

a bat that cannot find a blood meal will starve to death in less than three days, and yet on any given night. when a bat fails to find food, it will often "beg" another bat for food

Blood sharing between both related and unrelated vampire bats also occurs on a reciprocal basis

If the bats aren't familiar, the donor will regurgitate a small amount to sustain the recipient for a short period. If the bats are familiar (the recipient has previously provided blood to the donor before), more blood will be offered to sustain the starving bat

Furthermore, donor bats were more likely to approach starving bats and initiate the food sharing

bats who received blood from another individual were more likely to donate blood to that individual when it, in turn, was starved

Stage 2: Introduce cheaters — those individuals who try to beat the system by not sharing blood
